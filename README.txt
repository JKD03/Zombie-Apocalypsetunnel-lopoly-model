This Project is a Low Poly Model consisting of a hallway of a Building during a Zombie apocalypse.

For Creation of the following Low Poly model the steps involved were:-
1.	Take a cube and turn it into a rectangle shape like walls.
2.	Repeating the step 1 so we get 2 side walls a ceiling and a floor.
3.	Using the cube shape we will create frame for lights, doors and photo frames.
4.	The water cooler is the shape imported online.
5.	Then we will place the light frames, doors and the photo frames on the walls of our scene.
6.	Then we will apply texture to the doors and the walls under the shading option.
7.	Then we will place a light source(plane) inside of the light frame so it looks like a led light.
8.	The under the add object option, select import as plane under image option and add a zombie apocalypse poster.(So our image would be visible during rendering).
9.	Then selecting the doors , lights and poster we will duplicate them so we can get multiple objects like this in our scene.
10.	Now under lights we will set them as white color and 30-40 W as power as we don’t want our scene to be too bright.
11.	Now under add object we will insert a path and a camera.
12.	Then we will trace path in such a way we want our camera to go.
13.	Then we would place the camera at one end of the path (from where we want to start our animation).
14.	Then we will select camera and path and select follow path option.
15.	The we will select path and under Object data properties we will select path animation and Set Evaluation time for start and end of our camera path.
16.	Then we will smoothen our objects and giving them final touch so as they have matching color for our scene.
17.	Now we can render our animation As the desired Low Poly model is Generated.
